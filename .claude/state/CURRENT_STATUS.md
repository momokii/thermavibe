# Current Status — VibePrint OS

**Last Updated:** 2026-06-19
**Updated By:** Digital Sharing (Option 3) Gaps 1-3 implementation
**Session Summary:** Implemented the Digital Sharing feature end-to-end in a single batch (Option A Cloudflare Tunnel as default + Option B BIND_HOST LAN fallback). Gaps 1-3 complete: (1) backend now emits absolute share URLs when `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` is set; frontend handles both absolute and relative `qr_data`; cloudflared sidecar added as opt-in Docker Compose profile (`make dev-tunnel` / `make prod-tunnel`). (2) `/share/{token}` now returns an HTML landing page with mobile viewport, inline CSS, Download button, and operator branding; raw JPEG moved to `/share/{token}/image` sub-path. Expired/tampered tokens return a friendly 410 HTML page (not JSON). (3) `SHARE_URL_SCANNED` and `COMPOSITE_DOWNLOADED` analytics events fire on each hit, wrapped in try/except so a failed analytics write can never block the share response. New module `backend/app/services/share_page.py`, 19 new tests (11 integration + 8 unit). Fixed a pre-existing test-isolation bug: the middleware rate-limiter (`_rate_limit_store`) was never reset between tests, so my share tests ran into a 429 wall after earlier tests exhausted the quota — extended the autouse `reset_rate_limiter` fixture to clear it. Backend tests: 314 passing (was 303 baseline; same 4 pre-existing failures unrelated to this work). Frontend tests: 36 passing (was 32; 3 RevealScreen regressions also fixed via Proxy-based framer-motion mock). Gap 4 (Vibe Check parity) DEFAULT-SKIP per D-029. Operator smoke-test items flagged in update-roadmap.md §5.8: iOS Safari download behavior and end-to-end via mobile data cannot be verified from Linux dev environment.

## Overall Phase

**Phase 1 — Implementation (~90% complete)**

The backend is feature-complete for both the Vibe Check and Photobooth flows. The frontend kiosk shell, admin dashboard, marketing website, and production Docker deployment are all in place. Remaining work is hardening (security, E2E tests, CI) rather than core features.

**Overall Completion:** ~90%

## Remaining Work (Priority Order)

### Big Update Direction — Option 3: Digital Sharing — GAPS 1-3 SHIPPED 2026-06-19

> **Full spec:** [`docs/technical/update-roadmap.md` §5](../../docs/technical/update-roadmap.md)

**Status:** Gaps 1-3 implemented in one batch. Gap 4 (Vibe Check parity) DEFAULT-SKIP per D-029.

What's done:
- **Gap 1 (URL plumbing):** `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` env var → backend emits absolute URLs when set, relative when unset. Frontend (`PhotoboothRevealScreen.tsx`) detects absolute vs relative via regex and uses as-is or prepends `window.location.origin`.
- **Gap 1 (Tunnel sidecar):** Cloudflare Tunnel as Docker Compose opt-in profile (`profiles: ["tunnel"]`). `make dev-tunnel` / `make prod-tunnel` to enable. Default `make dev`/`make prod` unchanged.
- **Gap 1 (LAN fallback Option B):** `BIND_HOST` env var (default `127.0.0.1`, preserves D-025). `0.0.0.0` exposes the port to LAN for offline events without a tunnel.
- **Gap 2 (Landing page):** `/share/{token}` returns HTML with mobile viewport, inline CSS, Download button, operator branding from env vars. Raw JPEG moved to `/share/{token}/image` sub-path. New module `backend/app/services/share_page.py`. Expired/tampered tokens return 410 HTML.
- **Gap 3 (Analytics):** `SHARE_URL_SCANNED` and `COMPOSITE_DOWNLOADED` events fire on each hit. Try/except wraps every analytics write — share response never blocked by analytics failure (explicitly tested).

**Pending before going live (operator smoke-test, not implementable from Linux dev):**
- iOS Safari download behavior on the tunnel-served landing page
- End-to-end reachability via mobile data with a real Cloudflare Tunnel

**Deferred:**
- Gap 4 (Vibe Check share parity) — DEFAULT-SKIP per D-029, slow-media positioning preserved
- Admin dashboard share-rate rollups — not part of this batch; revisit when an operator needs the metric surfaced

**Also documented in the roadmap** (not current priority, but spec'd for future reference):
- **Option 1** — Multi-kiosk architecture. Full spec already in `docs/technical/multi-kiosk-architecture.md`. Start only when concrete multi-kiosk demand exists.
- **Option 2 MVP** — Single-kiosk remote monitoring (TOTP + push notifications). 2-3 days, only if kiosk is deployed off-site. The Cloudflare Tunnel sidecar from this batch is directly reusable for the remote-admin path.
- **Option 2 Full** — Multi-kiosk aggregation dashboard. Requires Option 1. Multi-month effort.

### Other Remaining Work

1. **SEC-001: Add non-root user to Dockerfile** — App container still runs as root. Only open item from the Phase 1 security audit.
2. **Expand frontend test coverage** — Only 32 frontend tests; admin pages, most hooks, and most screens lack tests. New photobooth screens (`PhotoboothCaptureScreen`, `FrameSelectScreen`, `ArrangeScreen`, `ReviewScreen`, `PhotoboothRevealScreen`, `AccessCodeScreen`) have no tests.
3. **Backend test coverage gaps** — New services added since the last snapshot (`access_code_service`, `photobooth_service`, `theme_service`, `image_composition_service`, `retention_service`, `share_service`) have unit tests but the integration test suite (4 files) does not yet exercise the photobooth flow end-to-end.
4. **Wave 5 — E2E & hardware testing** — Not started. Full kiosk flow in Docker with mock providers, real camera capture, real thermal printer, real AI provider, performance benchmarks.
5. **CI/CD pipeline** — No automated testing or deployment.

## Currently In Progress

**Nothing.** No tasks are currently in progress.

---

## Blocked Items

**Nothing.** No items are blocked.

---

## Known Gaps

1. **SEC-001: Docker container runs as root** — Dockerfile has no `USER` directive. Only remaining item from the Phase 1 security audit.
2. **Frontend test coverage thin** — 32 tests against 14 kiosk screens + 10 admin components + 13 pages + 8 hooks. Most new photobooth and admin work is untested.
3. **RevealScreen tests are failing (regression)** — All 3 tests in `frontend/src/__tests__/components/RevealScreen.test.tsx` fail with `Element type is invalid: ... got: undefined`, meaning a component used by `RevealScreen.tsx` is missing or wrongly imported (likely a `framer-motion` element not covered by the test's mock, which only stubs `motion.div`, `motion.img`, `motion.p`). Investigation needed; current state is **29 pass / 3 fail** out of 32.
4. **No photobooth integration test** — Unit tests exist but no end-to-end backend test for the photobooth state machine.
5. **No CI/CD pipeline** — Tests run only locally.
6. **Tests use SQLite, production uses PostgreSQL** — Minor gap in DB-level testing.
7. **In-memory rate limiter and payment store** — Acceptable for single-kiosk; would need Redis for multi-kiosk.
8. **`docs/technical/testing-strategy.md` §4.1 example drift** — The factory-pattern example imports `from app.models.payment import Payment` (nonexistent — `payment.py` is a stub) and uses `Session(**defaults)` instead of `KioskSession(**defaults)`. Doc-only fix; no code changes needed. Flagged inline in the doc.

## Security Findings

**Overall Posture: GREEN** (foundations solid, one production hardening item remaining)

### Confirmed Safe
- No hardcoded secrets, API keys, or tokens in source code
- `.env` properly gitignored
- All database queries use parameterized statements
- JWT auth with constant-time PIN comparison and rate limiting
- Input validation via Pydantic v2 on all request bodies
- Photos deleted after session completion (privacy-first)
- Composite images expire via retention service

### Issues Status
| ID | Issue | Status |
|----|-------|--------|
| SEC-001 | Docker container runs as root (no `USER` directive) | **OPEN** |
| SEC-002 | No API rate limiting beyond auth endpoint | **DONE** — `RateLimitMiddleware` is now global |
| SEC-003 | No request/response size limits | **DONE** — `RequestSizeLimitMiddleware` added |
| SEC-004 | CORS allows all methods/headers | **DONE** — restricted to `GET/POST/PUT` and `Content-Type/Authorization/X-Request-ID` |

Full details in `.claude/SECURITY_STANDARDS.md`

## Open Questions

1. Should payment store be persisted to the database instead of in-memory? (Current: in-memory, acceptable for single-kiosk)
2. Should rate limiter use Redis for distributed deployments? (Current: in-memory, acceptable for single-kiosk)
3. What is the production CORS policy? (Current: configurable via env var, defaults to localhost)
4. Is there a Content Security Policy requirement for the kiosk browser?
